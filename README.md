# Field Guide

![Field Guide screenshot](screenshot.png)

Using Craft CMS? Keep Field Guide open while you write your templates!

Field Guide adds a tab to your Dashboard that lists all your fields in a single page, _grouped by section_.  Matrix sub-fields are displayed in indented rows and and all field names are linked to their editing pages.

To install, drag the `fieldguide` directory to `craft/plugins`. Activate the plugin under Settings â†’  Plugins. A new tab titled Field Guide should appear in the control panel.

Many thanks to [Daniel Ott](http://github.com/danieltott) for his significant improvements.
