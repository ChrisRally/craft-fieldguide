# Field Guide

Field Guide outputs a page in your Dashboard that lists all your sections and the fields attached to them. Keep it open while you write your templates!

Hoping to add Matrix sub-field listings soon.

To install, drag the `fieldguide` directory to `craft/plugins`. Visit Dashboard → *Gear Icon* → **+New Widget** → Field Guide Widget. The widget just contains a link to the Field Guide page.
