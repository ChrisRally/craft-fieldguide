# Field Guide

![Field Guide screenshot](screenshot.png)

Using Craft CMS? Field Guide adds a tab to your Dashboard that lists all your fields in a single page, _grouped by section_. Keep it open while you write your templates!

To install, drag the `fieldguide` directory to `craft/plugins`. Activate the plugin under Settings â†’  Plugins. A new tab titled Field Guide should appear in the control panel.
